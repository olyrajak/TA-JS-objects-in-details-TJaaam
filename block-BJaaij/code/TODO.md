## An object-oriented book-list!

- [ ] Create a class BookList
- [ ] Create another class called Book

#### Each Book should have several properties:

1. Title
2. Category
3. Author
4. isRead (default to `false`)
5. finishedDate

Book class will have the following methods:

- `markBookAsRead` when called will change the `isRead` property on the book to be `true`. It will also change the `finishedDate` to be the `Date.now()` when this function is called.

#### BookList should have the following properties:

1. An array of all the Books
2. Current read book index

#### BookList Methods

- [] `add([Book])` will accept an array (list of books). Once the method is called the book will added to the list.
- [] `getCurrentBook()` should return the current book using the `index` and the book array
- [] `getNextBook()` should return the next book using the `index` and the book array
- [] `getPrevBook()` should return the previous book using the `index` and the book array
- [] `changeCurrentBook` should accept one parameter and update the current index.

After creating the Book and BookList class create 5 book object and add it to list. Test all the methods in Book and BookList class.

```js
class Book {
  constructor(title, category, author) {
    this.title = title
    this.category = category
    this.author = author
    this.isRead = false
    this.finishedDate = null
  }
  markBookAsRead() {
    this.isRead = true
    this.finishedDate = Date.now()
  }
}

class bookList {
  constructor() {
    this.AllBooks = []
    this.index = 0
  }
  add([Book]) {
    return this.AllBooks.push(Book)
  }
  getCurrentBook() {
    return this.AllBooks[this.index]
  }
  getNextBook() {
    this.index++
    return this.AllBooks[this.index]
  }
  getPrevBook() {
    this.index--
    return this.AllBooks[this.index]
  }
  changeCurrentBook() {
    return (this.index = index)
  }
}

let book1 = new Book(
  'The Old Man and the Sea',
  'Allegory, Nautical fiction',
  'Ernest Hemigway',
)

let book2 = new Book('Harry Potter', 'Fantasy', 'J K Rowling')
let book3 = new Book('Lord of the rings', 'Fantasy', 'Tolkins')
let book4 = new Book('Wings of fire', 'Autobiography', 'A P J')
let book5 = new Book('Animal Farm', 'Political Satire', 'Gorge Orewell')
let book6 = new Book('Trapped', 'Fantasy', 'Peter')

let bookList1 = new Booklist()

bookList1.add([book1, book2, book3, book4, book5, book6])
```
